You are managing tasks using the Workspace TODO system with natural language processing.

## User Command: {{command}}

## Your Task:

1. **Load Workspace Configuration**: 
   - Read workspace paths from `~/.claude/workspace-path.txt` which contains:
     - `WORKSPACE_DIR=<framework-path>`
     - `WORKSPACE_DATA_DIR=<data-path>`
   - If config file doesn't exist, inform user to run bootstrap script first
   - Use `WORKSPACE_DATA_DIR/todo/` for all TODO operations

2. **Parse Natural Language Command**: 
   - Analyze the user's command to determine intent and extract information
   - Common intent patterns:
     - **Create/Add**: "create", "add", "new", "make" → Create new task
     - **List/Show**: "list", "show", "view", "see" → Display tasks  
     - **Complete**: "done", "complete", "finish", "mark as done" → Mark task complete
     - **Update**: "change", "update", "modify", "edit" → Modify existing task
     - **Review**: "review", "summary", "status" → Show task overview
     - **Help**: "help", "manual", "guide" → Show help information

3. **Extract Task Information**:
   - **Task description**: Clean, organized, actionable title
   - **Priority**: high/urgent/critical, medium/normal/regular, low/minor
   - **Due date**: tomorrow, friday, "feb 15", "2026-02-15", "in 3 days", "next monday"
   - **Tags**: work, personal, health, code, etc.
   - **Context**: Additional details, links, requirements, POCs

4. **Handle Ambiguity**:
   - If multiple interpretations possible, ask for clarification
   - If date is ambiguous ("friday" - this week or next?), ask which
   - If task reference unclear ("first task" but multiple high-priority), ask which
   - Show what you understood and confirm before proceeding

5. **Execute Operation**:

   - **CREATE**: Add new task to `active.md`
     - Organize title for clarity and actionability
     - Extract context for separate field
     - Parse priority, due date, tags from natural language
     - Format: `- [ ] <clean-title>`
     - Include: priority, created, due (if specified), tags (if specified), context (if provided)
   
   - **LIST**: Display numbered active tasks from `active.md`
     - Number tasks: "1. Fix authentication bug"
     - Sort: overdue first (⚠️), then by due date, then priority, then creation date
     - Show: task number, priority indicator, title, due date
     - Format: "1. ⚠️ [HIGH] Submit quarterly report (due: 3 days ago)"
   
   - **COMPLETE**: Mark task as done
     - Parse task reference: "first task", "task 2", "the auth bug"
     - If ambiguous reference, show options and ask for clarification
     - Mark complete and move to archive with completion date
   
   - **UPDATE**: Modify existing task
     - Parse what to change: priority, due date, title, context, tags
     - Parse which task: by number or description
     - Update the specified fields
   
   - **REVIEW**: Show task summary
     - Total tasks by priority
     - Overdue tasks (⚠️)
     - Due this week
     - Oldest tasks without due dates
   
   - **HELP**: Display natural language usage guide

6. **Data Format**: Use the enhanced Workspace TODO format with context:
   ```markdown
   - [ ] Clean, actionable task title
     - priority: medium
     - created: 2026-01-31
     - due: 2026-02-15
     - tags: [work, urgent]
     - context: Additional requirements, links to docs, POC details, technical notes
   ```

7. **Error Handling**: 
   - If no workspace found: Inform user and suggest running bootstrap script
   - If task not found: Show numbered task list to help user identify the right one
   - If command is ambiguous: Ask for clarification with specific options
   - If date is unclear: Ask which specific date is meant
   - If no active tasks: Suggest creating a new task

/todo add task due in 3 days: test deployment

# With context and details
